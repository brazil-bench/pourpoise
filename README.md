Purpose management for this organization

The purpose of this organization is to generate benchmark results that compare approaches to agent development management on the same task.

The standard task is to create an MCP server for a brazilian football statistics knowledge graph, and every benchmark starts with an empty repo that contains the spec, which is created from the benchmark-template repo provided here.

A secondary purpose is to explore and develop mechanisms that automate the development management of agents in a purposeful way.
